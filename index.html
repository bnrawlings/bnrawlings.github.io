    <H1>A little Bit about Britt</H1>
    <p>
        Growing up my grandparents said that I wanted to be everything when I grew up. One visit I might say doctor, the next a gymnast until it became a running joke for me to come up with a new career I wanted to pursue. Still to this day I want to be everything haha! 
        I've been a 
        <ol>
            <li>CNA</li>
            <li>Logistics Analyst</li>
            <li>Civilian Contractor</li>
            <li>Event Coordinator</li>
            <li>....and now a future Devlepor!</li>
        </ol>
        Outside of my overly ambitious resume, I'm actully very chill
        and enjoy most of my freetime by napping or reading (occasionally binge watching GoT and The Office).
        I have 2 wonderful fur babies and a beautiful wife I have to compete for thier attention with.
        Can't wait to begin this new career!
